If you are reading this you are hopefully enjoying the lovely [UPSCALE CONF 2025](https://www.upscaleconf.com/) and if you are not, you should be! This will be used as an example of how to use GitHub Models to enhance your AI applications and how to you build iteratively with them.

## How to install dependencies

Hopefully the codespace is setup correctly, but sometimes the python environment doesn't get setup correctly. The easiest way to resolve this is to run the following command:

```bash
npm run build-backend
```

## How to run the server

```bash
npm start
```

## How to look at GitHub Models

Take a peek over at [/models](the models tab) and take a look at what models are available and start looking at some example code and how we can start using them. You can even start iterating with prompt building and see how the models respond.
